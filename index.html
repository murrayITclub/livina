  <h3> All about me </h3>
<p> Hi there my name is Livina as you can tell by the title ;). I want to tell you some things about me that some people might not know about me before they read this.</p>
 <p> I play sports such as softball, volleyball, and swimming. I have 3 sisters that are all younger than me which makes me the oldest. I am a TOTAL NERD. I have loved school for most of my life exept when I have homework. My favorite class is history. I love learning about our past and how it effected us today. I am in debate, I love debating things with people. I also love to draw and write my own stories mostly fantasy.
